#summary Application View Files

===Location===
`./nu/application/view/`

===Filepath Format===
`/[ControllerName]/[ViewName].view.php`

View files are organized into sub-directories under `./nu/application/view/`, and sub-directories are named after Controllers wherein the View file will be used. So view files for Home Controller shall be under `./view/Home/`.

View filenames should end with the suffix `view.php`, and the View names usually correspond to an Action under the Controller wherein it shall be used. For example, `./Home/index.view.php` is the default view for `Home::index()`.

===View Files Content===
View files can contain any form of text, even PHP, but we suggest you use PHP minimally in View files (minimize to use only echos) as business logic should be in the Controllers.

===View Data ($data)===
View data can be accessed through the $data array, data in this array is populated from the Controller.
{{{
<p><?php echo $data['message']; ?>
}}}

===Global View Files===
Global view files are view files that are available in every Controller, these files are stored under `./view/_global/`. The Controller loads global view files by using the {{{$this->view->load('page', true);}}}, notice the second parameter, when true this means that the View named `page` should be loaded from the global directory and not under the current Controller's View subdirectory.
