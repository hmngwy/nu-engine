#summary Application Controller Classes.
#labels Phase-Implementation

===Location===
{{{./nu/application/controller/}}}

===File===
{{{[ControllerName].controller.php}}}

Your controller class name should match the filename with '.controller.php' suffix, for Linux users this is case-sensitive, to be on the safe side, use case-sensitive naming.

===Class===
{{{class Home extends BaseController}}}

Your controller class should extend `BaseController` and should have the default action `public function index(){}`.

  ====Sample====
  {{{
  class Home extends BaseController
  {
      public function index()
      {
          return $this->output();
      }
  }
  }}}

===Adding an Action===
To add an Action, just add a `public function` with any name, do not forget to add it to the routes definition file.

===Manipulating View===
By default, the associated View file for an Action will be 
{{{
./nu/application/view/[ControllerName]/[ActionName].view.html
}}}
By default, the view file will be the current Action's name under the view directory with the Controller's name.

To change the view file, use
{{{
$this->view->load($viewname);
}}}
So for example, if `$this->view->load('page');` in any Action under `Home` Controller is called, your view file will be 
{{{
./nu/application/view/Home/page.view.html
}}}

If the View file exists, it's content will be in 
{{{
$this->view->getContent();
}}}
This is available so that if you want to manipulate the View filestring and just echo it afterwards (see Returning Output below), like using a third part template engine.

To replace this, use
{{{
$this->view->setContent($content);
}}}
Where $content is a string. Note: This will not change the View file, but the loaded file string into $this->view->content;

===Manipulating View Data===
View data will be accessible through `$data` in your View files.

To add a view data, use
{{{
$this->view->addData($key, $content);
}}}

To get a view data, use
{{{
$this->view->getData($key);
}}}

To remove a view data, use
{{{
$this->view->remData($key);
}}}

===Adding Headers===
To add a header, use 
{{{
$this->addHeader($string);
}}}
Sending of headers will be deferred until output is returned to the nu-engine. (see Returning Output below). 

===Returning Output===
To end the action and respond to the request, use
{{{
return $this->output($mode);
}}}
This shall return the output data and instructions to the nu-engine, and in turn the nu-engine shall push out the data as instructed.

  ====$mode paramater====
  This tells nu-engine whether to echo the view file contents included in the output object, or include the view file directed in the output instance.
  {{{
  # echo content
  return $this->output('e');

  # include view file
  return $this->output('i');
  }}}
