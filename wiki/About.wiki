With my intense enthusiasm for the project, sleepless nights, and really bad headaches, it has come to my attention that I have left out on some introduction and attributions, and I feel really sad about it. So here it is.

===Introduction===

The project sprouted from PHPit.net article about writing a simple PHP MVC application, the site is currently down and it seems that it has been that way for some time now. So here is [http://web.archive.org/web/20080128233521/http://www.phpit.net/article/simple-mvc-php5 the article] cached in archive.org.

The project started from a school project and has since been further improved to become a fully fledged MVC framework without the bloat, it's written very straightforward, in a pattern the way you'd think how an MVC framework would work, rather nonindustrial way of doing it but it has proved to be the most desired way to do it.
