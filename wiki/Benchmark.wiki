===Equipment===
The benchmark test was run using [http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/programs/ab.html ApacheBench], Version 2.3 <$Revision: 655654 $> on a machine with these specs:
  * Windows XP PRO Version 2002 SP2
  * Intel Pentium Dual CPU E2180 @ 2.00 GHz
  * 2.00 GHz, 1.00 GB of RAM
  * Seagate Barracuda 7200.11 500GB ST3500320AS HDD

Using [http://www.wampserver.com/en/ WampServer]:
  * Apache 2.2.11
  * MySQL 5.1.32
  * PHP 5.2.9-1 

===Methodology===
All frameworks were configure to output "Hello World!" in plain text from a view file.

Each benchmark test was run using this command:
{{{
ab -c 10 -t 60 http://localhost/
}}}

Concurrency level set to 10, and run test for 60 seconds.
